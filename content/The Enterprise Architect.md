## The Enterprise Architect

__The Architect__ participates in the consistency, adaptability and sustainability of the entire information system by complying with business objectives and strategy, taking into account external and internal constraints (risks, costs, deadlines, etc.), complying with architecture practices, as well as rules and principles currently inforce and guaranteeing the relationship between business needs and their software implementation

__Primary Responsibilities__
- Contribute to the consistency and sustainability of the IS, help analyze the impacts related to the integration of a new architecture block or update an existing block;
- Support studies, projects and portfolios when designing their architecture;
- Participate to the architecture committees;
- Contribute to the promotion of architecture requirements for projects and portfolios to ensure compliance with quality criteria;
- Contribute to monitoring functional architecture directives and rules in projects and/or portfolios;
- Contribute to the distribution and transfer of knowledge of target architectures and functional and application architecture principles and rules to all teams;
- Document the architecture solutions and their components;
- Help assist studies, projects and portfolios when designing/enhancing their architecture and implementing them throughout the project life cycle, and control their implementation;
- Define, document and maintain the foundations of the reference architecture and participate in streamlining the IS by contributing to its ongoing development.


##Architect (partial/optional)
Traditionally, this role is responsible for conducting enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation, using a __big picture__ approach to ensure a successful development and execution of strategy. Those goals can still exist in many large organizations, but the role of an architect is evolving to be an enabler for more self-sufficient, and decoupled teams. Too often this role has become a “Dr. No” in most large organizations, so care must be taken to ensure that the architect supports the team, not the other way around.

Architects are typically more senior technical staff who are “domain experts.” They may also be more technically astute and in a consultative way help ensure the long-term quality and flexibility of the software that the team creates, share best practices with teams, and otherwise enables the teams to be successful. As such, this role may be a fully dedicated one who, hopefully, still spends much of their time coding so as not to “go soft” and lose not only the trust of developers but an intimate enough knowledge of technology to know what’s possible and not possible in contemporary software.

>“In reality, architecture is 90% people and 10% architecture,” says Blosch. “As an enterprise architect, to provide real value to your organization, you must be able to bring people together in whatever way works, and help them collaborate.” -- Marcus Blosch, research vice president at Gartner.

Typically, an enterprise architect knows whether or not the company has properly set up their information systems. If the company has not, which is usually the case, the architect should have a roadmap for how to move to a suitable landscape of information systems


## EA Changes 
[From: Enterprise Architecture Made Simple]

- Why should we do this?
- Is everybody aware of why?
- Who takes responsibility for the problem, is affected by the problem, or will benefit from solving the problem?
- Who should participate?
- What are the risks?
- Are there ongoing parallel activities to consider?
- Are there previous results we can reuse?
- What are the key success factors for this kind of work?

__Establish a clear picture of the challenges facing people in the organization.__ It is easier to gain people’s respect and commitment for the EA process if the need for it is well understood and convincing. If there is not a broad awareness of the reason for developing an enterprise architecture, extra energy will need to be devoted to motivating participants. Instilling motivation for EA in all workers requires sending out carefully worded invitations to participate in meetings, broadcasting the attendance of a senior manager at major workshops, making educational presentation materials easily available, and having a project manager who is continuously prepared to persuade participants of the importance of continuing the EA process.

__Identify your strategically important processes.__ They need special attention in your EA. Strategically important processes are those that make the business unique. It is because of these processes that there are customers who choose to buy from your organization and keep coming back. Unique processes allow the organization to become a market leader and stand out from its competition.

__Motivating an EA venture solely on the grounds of reduced IT costs is seldom successful.__ In part, the benefits to the business from undertaking such a venture are uncertain, since new costs may arise before there has been time to implement an architecture plan, and because, in part, EA requires a great deal of perseverance. Furthermore, the gains derived from more efficient IT are not usually significant. Some claim that the effect on IT does not exceed the cost of the architecture venture. For this reason, presentations about EA implementation should place more emphasis on the numerous benefits to in-house operations and the external environment than on how much EA will lower IT costs.

__NOTE__: If the information that is common for the entire organization was readily available to all systems, integration would be considerably easier.


## EA Competencies 
[From: Enterprise Architecture Made Simple]

- __Modeler/Analyst.__ Conducts and supervises modeling workshops. Creates new models, conducts analyses, and draws conclusions based on the workshops’ results. Deals with processes, information, and matrices.
- __Change manager.__ Ensures that EA work is implemented. Deals extensively with leading business operations through the change process. Cultural change is often one of the greatest challenges when working in this role.
- __Strategist.__ Works to safeguard the benefit of the EA work in the long term. Work includes identifying EA activities based on the business plan. Works closely with the Informant to identify current business problems for which EA could provide solutions.
- __Processor.__ Acts as a “motor” in the architecture process to motivate and impel others. Has a capacity to get things happening and reacts rapidly and pragmatically to initiate new events. Displays leadership qualities and may be the person who convenes meetings and distributes tasks.
- __Sponsor.__ A leader who is responsible for continuity. Not directly involved in daily EA work.
- __Model manager.__ Manages models and definitions. Supplies projects and business managers with existing models. Publishes, distributes, and manages different versions of the models. Often has a different profile than the modeler, but it is possible for them to be the same person.
- __Architect.__ Responsible for the enterprise architecture and its links to management, projects, and the business. Ensures that projects adhere to the intentions of the architecture.
- __Informant.__ Understands the benefits of EA and is able to communicate these benefits throughout the organization. If information officers already exist within the organization, it is beneficial to use them instead of creating the Informant role.


## EA involvement in projects 
[From: Enterprise Architecture Made Simple]

- The project manager is provided with guidelines regarding its scope and results. 
- The enterprise architect informs the project manager about the EA governance model and the entity managers and forums in particular.
- The project’s workers are supplied with previous results that have the potential to be reused. Together, the project workers and the enterprise architect discuss the project’s expected results, and this information is relayed back to the enterprise architect.
- Integration guidelines concerning sourcing and how to reuse information are discussed. In many cases, the process of phasing out systems is also included in the scope of the project.
- The project team decides and plans the enterprise architect’s level of commitment in the project, which can include the following:
    - Making existing results available, such as process and information models
    - Performing a number of quality assurance activities                     Acting as a resource for the project
    - Taking on complete responsibility for the architecture.


## EA
[From: The Enterprise Architecture at Work]

Enterprise architecture should be seen as a __management instrument__. [...] According to COBIT, well-defined architectures are the basis for a good internal control environment.

Enterprise architecture is very much a holistic approach to the design of organisations.

[From: https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-books-for-enterprise-architecture]
__Enterprise Architecture is a very unsuccessful field__. The classical approaches look good in theory (or not even that), but there is no sign that they are actually very effective. E.g. the ‘planning-oriented’ approaches have trouble coping with the unknowability and unpredictability of the real world.

_[...] Ask questions to get to real issues before coming up with proposed solutions or approaches. Make sure the real issues are understood and then do what is necessary to address those issues through the architectural work._

Application Portfolio Management

## Modeling
[From: The Enterprise Architecture at Work]
To ensure conceptual integrity, one can use subordinate design principles such
as: 

- do not link what is independent (__orthogonality__), 
- do not introduce multiple functions that are slightly divergent (__generality__), 
- do not introduce what is irrelevant (__economy__; sometimes denoted as __parsimony__), and 
- do not restrict what is inherent (__propriety__).


## Quantitative and Functional Analysis

## IT improvement
[From: DevOps Handbook]
"Every company is a technology company"
"It is virtually impossible to make any business decision that doesn’t result in at least one IT change".
"Business leaders are far more reliant upon the effective management of IT in order to achieve their goals than they think"


## The Evolution of Enterprise Architecture
[From:https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-evolution-of-enterprise-architecture/]

"By 2021, 40% of organizations will use enterprise architects to help ideate new business innovations made possible by emerging technologies", says Marcus Blosch, Vice President Analyst, Gartner. "EA and technology innovation leaders must use the latest business and technology ideas to create new revenue streams, services and customer experiences."

### Collaborative approach to EA
The need for collaboration across organizations is increasing, with the business demanding digital transformation and using its IT resources to do so. Because the EA team will remain relatively small, it must add value by orchestrating collaboration between different groups. In fact, by 2022, Gartner predicts 80% of digital businesses will take a collaborative approach to EA, involving participants across business and IT, and potentially beyond. The tools and techniques of EA remain invaluable, but the real contribution of enterprise architects is their ability to consult, coach and mentor, and drive business outcomes.

### EA as an internal management consultancy
New business models will bring together new customers, services and experiences, but this isn’t possible without business architecture to help design and shape the execution. Business architects will need to work closely with business teams, so much so that by 2022, 80% of business architects will work directly for a business leader. This will position EA as an internal management consultancy, where less time is spent gathering data and more time is spent using data for decision-making purposes. Business architecture combines and validates the building blocks necessary to deliver future-state business capabilities, so __if business architects don’t work closely with business leaders, technology-enabled initiatives will be impeded__.


## The definitive enterprise architecture blueprint
[https://www.orbussoftware.com/media/3992661/the-definitive-enterprise-architecture-blueprint.pdf]
An enterprise architecture practice makes it possible to model the entire organization and make informed strategic decisions. If treated as a consultancy within IT, it will provide a holistic view of the infrastructure and organization. From here solutions across the business can be derived with a full understanding of their implications, and an effective real-time analysis
of their success.

## Complex Enterprise Architecture: A New Adaptive Systems Approach
[https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complex-enterprise-architecture/9781484243060/html/469994_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/complex-enterprise-architecture/9781484243060/html/469994_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml)

_"One of the flawed assumptions of traditional enterprise architecture frameworks is that an architecture is an enduring artifact. In practice, all architecture is ephemeral. Where a properly constructed reference architecture may endure for some notable time (perhaps as long as a year), any other architecture should be treated as a transient artifact with limited long-term utility._

_An architecture is a fundamentally temporal artifact. Whether it is an enterprise architecture or solution architecture, it will describe one of two periods. The architecture will either reflect some desired end state of the enterprise or system (an objective or “to-be” architecture) or reflect the current state of the enterprise or system (an “as-is” architecture). Anything else is unimportant and potentially misleading."_
