## Initial
    Unpredictable and reactive. Work gets completed but is often delayed and over budget

## Managed
    Managed on the project level. Projects are planned, performed, measured, and controlled

## Defined
    Proactive, rather than reactive. Organisation-wide standards provide guidance across projects, programs and portfolios

## Quantitatively Managed
    Measured and controlled. Organisation is data-driven with quantitative performance improvement objectives that are predictable and align to meet the needs of internal and external stakeholders

## Optimizing
    Stable and flexible. Organisation is focused on contiguous improvement and is built to pivot and respond to opportunity and change. The organisations stability provides a platform for agility and innovation
