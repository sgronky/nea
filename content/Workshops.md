## Insights on Digital Transformation
Giving a definition of what __Digital Transformation__ means is quite complex. First, because, like most tech trends that get hyped up and overused as they become more mainstream, the term has been rendered quite nebulous and largely applied to address many different and varied concepts. 

Second, Digital is almost literally redefining industries and changing businesses, from optimization and operational exellence to disruptive innovation. It overcomes the traditional change management by fostering a new way of thinking and working that make great conditions for the rise of a super-fast economy. Which in turn has the effect of consolidating an environment where you win only when you make an extensive use of dynamic digital transformation.

In other words, it seems to be a sort of _circular referentiality_, inherently hidden inside the meaning of Digital Transformation. 

But along with an ineffable and complex aspect, there is a very concrete one. An aspect that pushes companies to change in order to compete and win, that makes clear the need to enable employees with new digital tools and know-how to think, act and work differently and that creates an unstoppable movement of continuous transformation.

> A __journey__ more than a destination. In which the digital strategy and corporate strategy have to be one and the same and outline the direction.

Fair enough, but then if it involves the strategy, it is meant to be something at C-level only. Nothing to do with us, as employees, right? 

False. 

Actually, CEOs need to champion digital transformations, but to be really effective it must be enterprise-wide and must involve everyone. We as employees cannot be expected to receive and apply changes in these ways if we donâ€™t fully understand how new tools, capabilities and technologies will affect our employee experience. 

So, are we all supposed to be expert in __Big Data Analytics__, __Machine Learning__ and __Cyber Security__? Probabily not. But, the other way around, can we just only imagine to take part at this broad change without even knowing what is concretely happening out there? 

>Being digital is not something we do, it's a mindset.

So the right answer is __co-creation__. 

Given proper tools and support, enabled employees can create solutions and products that management may never have thought about, that can accelerate innovation, productivity and growth. This starts with engaging employees at the front end of digital transformation and co-creating with them to reach new stages of innovation and growth.

So, these changes need to be supported by ongoing training, metrics, measures and cultural support. Corporate ambitions and practical realities have to be connected.

## News per Insite
The first "insights" workshop on Digital Transformation was held On Wednesday 11th, in Milan, at the Generali Tower. And it has been all about AI & Machine Learning. A great opportunity to start discussing about the main concepts and notions that underpin what stands to be the most radically transformative technology ever developed by humankind. 

The age of artificial intelligence is not simply here but has permeated through our very existence already. From forecasting market trends to reordering your groceries that were going low to being delivered by drones, artificial intelligence is all around our lives and the way we do business. 

We have had Artificial Intelligence just over the horizon for decades. From the cautionary tale of AI run amok in Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddissey, to the more recent romantic virtual assistant Samantha in Her, and many others. But today we are assured that AI is on the verge of reality and is configuring itself as a way to increase what we currently do, in almost every aspect of our life. 

And still, despite we'come such a long way, we are currently just at the base of a mountain - the only way forward from here is up. 

The workshop has been an opportunity to present some mind-blowing achievements in AI & Machine Learning and we've discussed how the advent of cloud computing and advances in machine intelligence algorithms developed and available for everyone to use, have created the conditions for a sort of "democratization"  for the AI to be largely applied right now.

Definitely, increasing our awareness of such thrilling new possibilities is a need. The professionals of tomorrow - in all industries and sectors - are already changing the way they think at their work today.
