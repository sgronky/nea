## What is Cloud? 
In Cloud Computing, the word cloud is used as a metaphor for “ the Internet.” In other words, we can say cloud is something, which is present at remote location. Well it is an abstraction of underlying infrastructures involved.

## What is Cloud Computing?
Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics and more- over the Internet(Cloud).
Cloud Computing consists of hardware and software resources made available on the internet as they are managed by the third party services. These services typically provides access to advanced software applications, high end networks of server computers. 
"You don't generate your own electricity. Why generate your own computing?“ -Jeff Bezos, Amazon.

## History 
- It was a gradual evolution that started in the 1950s with mainframe computing 
- After some time, around 1970, the concept of virtual machines (VMs) was created. 
- In 1999, Salesforce.com started delivering of applications to users using a simple website. 
- In 2002 Amazon provided First public cloud AWS (Amazon Web Service) , providing services like storage, computation.
- In 2009, Google Apps also started to provide cloud computing enterprise applications.
- In 2009, Microsoft launched Windows Azure, and companies like Oracle and HP have all joined the game. This proves that today, cloud computing has become mainstream.

## Benefits of cloud computing
- Drive down costs
- Accessibility 
- Productivity 
- Scalability 
- Access to automatic updates 
- Business Continuity (Back up & Recovery)
- Pay structure

## Simple Examples of cloud computing 

- __Email__: Web-based email services like Gmail and Hotmail deliver a cloud computing service: users can access their email "in the cloud" from any computer with a browser and Internet connection, regardless of what kind of hardware is on that particular computer. The emails are hosted on Google's and Microsoft's servers, rather than being stored locally on the client computer.

- __Office Productivity Software__: Office 365, Google docs and Zoho office. This software allow you to keep and edit your documents online. By doing so, the documents will be accessible anywhere, and you can share the documents and collaborate on them. Multiple people can work in the same document simultaneously. 
 
- __Storage__: One Drive, Google Drive, iCloud and Drop Box.

## Common Cloud Characteristics 
- On Demand Self Service 
- Broad network access 
- Multi-Tenancy (Resource Pooling) 
- Rapid Elasticity 
- Measured service

## Cloud Models 
- Deployment Models 
- Service Models

## Deployment Models 
A cloud deployment model represents a specific type of cloud environment, primarily distinguished by ownership, size, and access. 

There are three common cloud deployment models:

## Deployment Models 
- __Public Cloud__: Public clouds are owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the internet. As the name suggests, Public cloud is open to public. Anyone can access and use it by paying accordingly
- __Private Cloud__: The private cloud, in contrast to its public counterpart, isn't available to the public but is built specifically for a single organization to fit its needs. It may be managed internally or by a third-party and be hosted internally or externally. 
- __Hybrid Cloud__: A hybrid cloud is a combination of a private cloud combined with the use of public cloud services allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds. This model gives business greater flexibility and more deployment options

## Service Models 
In the world of cloud computing, there are three different approaches to cloud-based services:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):
is a cloud computing offering in which a vendor provides users access to computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking. Organizations use their own platforms and applications within a service provider’s infrastructure. Key features: 
- Instead of purchasing hardware outright, users pay for IaaS on demand. 
- Infrastructure is scalable depending on processing and storage needs. 
- Saves enterprises the costs of buying and maintaining their own hardware. 
- Because data is on the cloud, there is no single point of failure.

## Platform as a service (PaaS): 
is a cloud computing offering that provides users a cloud environment in which they can develop, manage, and deliver applications. In addition to storage and other computing resources, users are able to use a suite of prebuilt tools to develop, customize and test their own applications. Key features:
- PaaS provides a platform with tools to test, develop, and host applications in the same environment. 
- Enables organizations to focus on development without having to worry about underlying infrastructure. 
- Providers manage security, operating systems, server software, and backups. 
- Facilitates collaborative work even if teams work remotely.

## Software as a service (SaaS): 
is a cloud computing offering that provides users with access to a vendor’s cloud-based software. Users do not install applications on their local devices. Instead, the applications reside on a remote cloud network accessed through the web or an API. Through the application, users can store and analyze data and collaborate on projects. Key features: 
- SaaS vendors provide users with software and applications on a subscription model. 
- Users do not have to manage, install, or upgrade software; SaaS providers manage this. 
- Data is secure in the cloud; equipment failure does not result in loss of data. 
- Use of resources can be scaled depending on service needs.

## Pros and Cons 
__Pros__: 
- Reduced hardware equipment for end-users 
- Improved performance 
- Lower H/W and S/W maintenance 
- Instant software updates 
- Accessibility 
- Metered services 
- Less expensive 
- Improved Disaster Recovery 

__Cons__: 
- Requires good internet speed with good bandwidth 
- Security 
- Limited control on Infrastructure

## What is Microsoft Azure? 
Azure is a flexible cloud platform (PaaS) that enables you to quickly build, deploy and manage applications across a global network of Microsoft – managed datacenters. 
You can build applications using any language, tool or framework.

## Microsoft Azure - Virtual Machines: 
Azure gives you the ability to create VMs by simply specifying the size and virtual hard disks (VHD) you want to use. Azure provides access to both Windows and Linux VHDs, so the developers has a freedom to choose what they want to work. Developers can use VMs to build and test applications quickly at low cost. 
Web Sites: You can use Azure as a platform for creating and hosting websites and web applications

## Microsoft Azure - Mobile Services: 
Azure’s Mobile services give you the tools to create and deploy applications. The information that gets accessed by the app running on your device is stored in what’s called a back-end database, and so Mobile services are reffered to as mobile Back-end as a service (mBaaS). With Azure , you can build apps for Android, iOS, HTML / JavaScript and Windows Phone.

## Microsoft Azure 
Azure supports the broadest selection of operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases and devices. Build apps with JavaScript, Python, .NET, PHP, Java and Node.js; build back-ends for iOS, Android and Windows devices. Azure cloud service supports the same technologies millions of developers and IT professionals already rely on and trust.

## Conclusion 
- Cloud computing has quickly become one of the most prominent buzzwords in the IT world due to its revolutionary model of computing as a utility. It promises increased flexibility, scalability, and reliability, while promising decreased operational and support costs  Despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the organizations are slow in accepting it due to security issues and challenges associated with it. Security is one of the major issues which hamper the growth of cloud. The idea of handing over important data to another company is worrisome; such that the consumers need to be vigilant in understanding the risks of data breaches in this new environment.
