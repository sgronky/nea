##Note
- Sfruttando l'attuale organizzazione (di fatto già abbastanza strutturata a servizi), dovremmo costruire una rete di team a protezione di ciascun asset strategico, fortemente relazionata con il business e l'utente finale.
- Il primo step è quindi quello probabilmente di inventariare tutti gli asset strategici in gestione e garantire che siano presidiati a sufficienza
- Occorre successivamente valutare quali funzioni possano essere considerate "cross" e messe a disposizione di tutti i team
- Occorre inoltre una piattaforma di gestione del servizio, sia in termini di change, sia in termini di manutenzione. In aggiunta, sarebbe utile poter costruire una base di conoscienza attorno ai principali aspetti funzionali che orbitano attorno al servizio o asset.
- Per poter individuare in che modo costruire un service team, occorrerebbe valutare quali debbano essere gli skill posseduti dal team, in relazione alle attività che l'utente finale si aspetta vengano svolte dal team. 
- Esiste poi in generale una forte necessità di misure. Non solo tecniche, come MTTR o MTBF, ma anche e soprattutto KPI che abbiano valore per l'utente finale e siano facilmente comprensibili
- Occorre implementare metodi ingegneristici e uniformi nella gestione degli incident, sulla site reliability, ecc... Questi approcci andrebbero definiti e strutturati a livello generale, per poi essere implentati a livello dei singoli team.

__IT Platform__.  
__IT is organized around a set of modular “platforms,” run by accountable platform (or product) teams__. Each platform consists of a logical cluster of activities and associated technology that delivers on a specific business goal and can therefore be run as a business, or “as a service,” as technologists say. These platforms are each managed individually, can be swapped in and out, and, when “assembled,” form the backbone of a company’s technology capability. Just as important is that the business and tech sides of the company work closely together and have the decision-making authority to move quickly.

This modular, platform-based IT setup of tech companies is what enables them to accelerate and innovate. They can experiment, fail, learn, and scale quickly: they can get products to market 100 times faster than their more lumbering peers (think weeks instead of months). With this kind of speed and flexibility, IT can and should become a focus for innovation and growth at the executive committee and board level. With new technologies and ways of working coming online, tech should be a competitive advantage, not a burden as it is in far too many companies today (see sidebar, “Why now?”).

__Platforms focus on business solutions to serve clients (internal or external) and to supply other platforms__. They operate as independent entities that bring together business, technology, governance, processes, and people management and are empowered to move quickly. They are run by a platform owner, who takes end-to-end responsibility for providing the solution and operating it like a service. Platform teams are cross-functional, with business, IT, and anything else that is needed, such as analytics, risk management, and so on. (Some companies call this a “tribe.”) They work in an agile manner, delivering the solution itself, enabling continuous business-led innovation, and developing and running all necessary IT.

Platforms are distinct units, but their value is based on how effectively they work together. Most companies overlook the criticality of making all IT components work together seamlessly because their attention is focused on individual projects. While most organizations understand the need to coordinate, the best ones develop a __Mission Control capability__ with the resources and authority to lead and manage across platforms in three ways:

1. Make strategic and allocation decisions.
2. Set and enforce standards for speed and interoperability.
3. Manage and coordinate programs that cut across platforms.

__Assess the fitness of the platform portfolio__.  
Business and IT should together quickly cluster the company’s activities and associated IT into a set of 20 to 40 platforms that cover customer journeys, business capabilities, and core IT. This does not have to be definitive, just a useful starting point. Then __conduct a fitness check__ on each platform: “fit” platforms are in good shape and only need investment to innovate and capture more value; “healthy” platforms work now but need modernization to prepare for future requirements; and “sick” platforms are no match for what competitors can do. They need a complete overhaul. DBS, one of Asia’s leading banking groups, used a similar approach and communicated the assessment to the whole market at the end of 2017. Visualizing the fitness of all platforms is powerful because it enables an executive team to have the right debate on tough trade-offs and priorities and to then assertively reallocate resources (Exhibit 3).
