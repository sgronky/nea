# Enterprise Architecture & APM
## Top 12 reasons to use Application Portfolio Management

1. __Align apps with business needs.__
Identify which apps support which business capabilities and eliminate those that don’t fulfill a valuable business purpose.

2. __Get the future ready__
Modernizing some apps, eliminating others and ditching technical debt frees up budget which can be used for innovation.

3. __Reduce compliance risks__
A complete picture of the apps you are running helps protect you from potential compliance failures. That’s a lot more than a nice-to-have when the penalties for non-adherence to new regulations, such as the EU’s GDPR, can run to eight figures per infringement.

4. __Improve efficiency__
Consolidating vendors, getting rid of duplicate apps and ensuring you have the right number of licenses streamlines app management effort and costs.

5. __Mitigate technical risks__
Legacy apps and unsupported licenses can be security and compliance time-bombs. Application Portfolio Management helps to defuse them.

6. __Save money__
Eliminating dispensable apps, and unused licenses could help cut software costs by as much as 15% without affecting business performance.

7. __Move to the cloud__
Many applications can serve the business better from the cloud. But your organization won’t benefit until they are identified. The right Application Portfolio Management overview can help you identify them.

8. __Eliminate redundancy__
Many apps come with a lot of functionality that most organizations will never need or use. The ability to link apps to business capabilities helps you identify which ones you can do without, so you can get rid of them.

9. __Optimize business processes__
Once you have rationalized your app portfolio, gaps and redundancies that slow down processes will become clear – then you can eliminate them.

10. __Get outsourcing right__
By knowing which apps and services are critical, you can make better decisions about what to outsource before you sign any agreements.

11. __Prioritize projects__
Active Application Portfolio Management helps you prioritize projects and associated applications according to the business value they deliver, and eliminate those that aren’t pulling their weight.

12. __Consolidate infrastructure__
A smaller number of more valuable apps allows you to reduce or reallocate infrastructure resources accordingly.

## Questions we could try to answer within the POC
- What is the state of health of the current IT landscape (e.g., number of applications in a decommissioning state over the total, redundant applications over total, applications in rollout over total, custom applications versus market applications, Managed vs Outsourced) ? Slide 14 pdf, Slide 58 pdf

## Application Portfolio Rationalization
_From: LeanIX White paper_

Primarily focused on driving fiscal growth, the business side requires a fast-paced business - often overlooking the need to continuously align the supporting IT landscape. Consequently, various applications are introduced at different points of time with overlapping functionality, different lifecycles, and technologies, which often results in major integration issues and various
business-wide inefficiencies. Running a complex, rigid IT ecosystem can increase IT spend, while directly decreasing the quality of service and satisfaction of those who rely on it.

__Application portfolio rationalization__ is the act of streamlining the existing application portfolio with an explicit goal of improving efficiency, reducing complexity, and lowering total cost of ownership (TCO) through a myriad of processes. Application rationalization sets the basis for other cost-saving endeavors, including:

- Software license optimization
- Application retirement 
- Server optimization
- Project rationalization
- Data storage optimization
- Retiring outdated and low-value applications
- Eliminating redundancies
- Standardizing common technology platforms.

Application rationalization, or active application portfolio management, is crucial to the overall health of the company, as there will always be a future event that calls for adjusting the application landscape. Various naturally occurring business events directly contribute to IT landscape complexity, including mergers & acquisitions, global outsourcing, rapid growth, and the introduction of new business goals or processes.

Application rationalization is an effective way to identify capital for reinvestment. In our rapidly evolving IT environment, leaders are under pressure to integrate new technologies that improve overall efficiency
including cloud computing, machine learning, artificial
intelligence and big data. Integrating these potentially beneficial technologies takes a considerable amount of time, energy, and focus away from resources that are currently dedicated to maintaining existing complex
systems.

Application rationalization also helps organizations streamline processes, reduce maintenance cost, enhance overall quality and efficiency, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), ensure compliance, and increase agility. It also frees up the time, money, and personnel to research and implement profit generating innovations.

Without active application portfolio management, organizations run the risk of application sprawl. Application sprawl is the unmanageable growth of an
IT portfolio. IT portfolios that experience application sprawl suffer from inefficiency due to poor design, lethargy, redundancies, and over exhausted resources. This could directly impede an organization’s ability to stay competitive and innovative. 

## Note
In questa prima fase potremmo indirizzare alcuni aspetti in particolare:
- IT landscape
- Budget e cost / revenues attribution
- Risk e Compliance
- Business Capability Map
- Infrastructure

Nell'indirizzare gli attuali problemi dell'IT, dovremmo puntare su alcuni aspetti particolari:
- Attuale situazione fuori controllo. Parco applicativo variegato e sostanzialmente disconnesso. Costituito da Silos che non parlano fra loro in molti casi, costituendo delle sorte di isole
- Poco controllo sulle esigenze attuali del business in termini di rinnovamento e business fit delle varie applicazioni e impossibilità di tracciare quali applicazioni forniscono maggior valore
- La contrazione del budget IT, visto sostanzialmente come una spesa più che come un'opportunità di generare valore, determina una necessità di individuare i settori (e le applicazioni principali) sulle quali investire
- Difficile tenere sotto controllo allo stato attuale, consumo del budget, differenti iniziative progettuali per ambito di business, costi e gestione dell'infrastruttura in termini evolutivi (p.e. migrazione verso scenari cloud)
